GeyserConnect is an easy way for Bedrock Edition clients to connect to any Java Edition servers without having to run anything.

## What is GeyserConnect?
GeyserConnect is a server that Minecraft: Bedrock Edition clients can connect to that allows for a list of Minecraft: Java Edition servers to be displayed and accessed through 1 public Geyser instance. It is effectively a combination of [BedrockConnect](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect) and [Geyser](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser).
